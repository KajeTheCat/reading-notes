## What is CSS?

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and it allows you to build and create great-looking web pages. CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create layout — for example turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation.

### Implementing CSS

External
With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file! Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the link element, inside the head section.

Internal 
An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style. The internal style is defined inside the style element, inside the head section.

Inline
An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element. To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.

Coloring
This can be done using a multitude of methods such as Hex, RGB, and HSL.
