# Permissions

Permissions checks are always run at the start of the view before any of the other code is allowed to run,to determine whether or not certain access should be granted or denied. When a check fails either a 403 forbidden or a 401 unauthorized will fire. Note that a serializer class should not raise permission denied in a list action, otheriwse the entire list will not be returned.
