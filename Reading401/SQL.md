# SQL
What does SQL stand for? Structured Query Language, to put it simply, it's a search language used to instruct a database about what information you want from it.

Select: A starting command like insert and create that will fetch for your search query. You can also use select to instruct a database to do some math.

From: Used to specify where to look when pulling your query.

'*' or Splat: A shortcut used to fetch all data from a specific table.

Order By: Used to specify the order the query is retrieved.

ASC and DESC: Used to order in ascending or descending order.

Limit: Used to restrict the results of the search to the specified number.

Offset: Used to skip results for example, skipping 1-9 to get search result 10-20.

Where: Used to set filter conditions for example between _ and _, or not between _ and _.
