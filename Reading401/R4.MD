# Classes and objects

Objects are containers of variables and functions that get the variables from classes.

## Fixtures

When writing tests usually you will write quite a few to test different bits of code, in some cases using fixtures to target more complex bits. Fixtures are objects available to your tests that might contain data to share across them or a network or file system to run through.
