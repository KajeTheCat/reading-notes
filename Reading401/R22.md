# Django best practices

Django ships with a built in user model for authentication, but a good practice is to make your own custom one, so as just a general rule, use a custom auth model for all projects. initial set up make sure NOT to run migrate until you've set up your new database. In settings.py we'll add the accounts app and use the AUTH_USER_MODEL config to tell Django to use our new custom user model in place of the built-in User model. call our custom user model CustomUser, within INSTALLED_APPS add accounts at the bottom. Then at the bottom of the entire file, add the AUTH_USER_MODEL config and at this point you can add the model.
