# Json Web token

open standard that defines a compact and contained way for securely transmitting info between parties as a json object. the info can be verified and trusted due to it's being digitally signed. You should use json tokens for authorization or info exchange. In its compact form, JSON Web Tokens consist of three parts separated by dots which are: header,payload,signature.

+ The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token, and the signing algorithm being used.
+ The second part of the token is the payload, which contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity and additional data. There are three types of claims: registered, public, and private claims.
+ The signature is used to verify the message wasn't changed along the way, and, in the case of tokens signed with a private key, it can also verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is.
