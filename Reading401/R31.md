# Creating a Next.js app

There are a few things that need to be considered when building an app with react from scratch.

+ The code has to be bundled using something like a webpack and transformed using a compiler
+ you need to do production optimizations such as code splitting
+ you may want to statically pre-render some pages for performance, and might also want to consider using server-side rendering/client side rendering.
+ you may have to write some server-side code to connect your react app to your data store.

Generally, a framework can help solve these issues, but, said framework must have the right level of abstraction. It also needs to have a great Dev experience, ensuring your team having a good time writing the code.

## Enter Next.js

Next.js is a strong framework aiming to have best-in-class dev experience and several built-in features like:

+ page-based routing system
+ pre-rendering
+ automatic code splitting
+ built-in css support

to name a few.
