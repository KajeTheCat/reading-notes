# Pythonisms

## Dunder methods

These are special methods in python that are predefined methods you can use to enrich your classes. They are easily recognizable because they start and end with two underscores, for example, __init__ . dunder methods let you emulate the behavior of built-in types.

## Iterators

Just like decorators, iterators and their related techniques can appear alien and complicated at a first glance. Ofcourse you do need to be careful with iterators as you could create an endless loop, and if you catch it early, these are easy to fix.

## Generators

Generators can help condense certain things in your code such as reducing seven lines of code for an iterator to three lines of code.
