# Ethics

Google committed to not using it's AI for weapons and surveillance. Treading a very thin line as they continue their work, they needed to ensure the work didn't cross that line. Many people quit protesting a single contract, and if more people had done so google would have lost much progress and man power. This goes to show that communication is very important with not only employee to employer but also the owner of the company needs to keep their ears open. Ultimately they kept their toes in the water for the contract, but came out with statements of how they plan to make sure their tech doesn't get used for harmful purposes.

The moral of this story is that you should always keep a clear mind of what is right and wrong for not only yourself but also your peers. This goes to show a strong suit for having good ethics or bad.
