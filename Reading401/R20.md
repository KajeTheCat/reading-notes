# Django Models

Django web apps access and manage data through models, aka the structure of stored data. It's always a good idea to keep in mind what data will need to be stored when making your model, as well as the relationships between the different objects. You may also want to use models to represent selection-list options (for example a drop down menu), rather than hard coding the choices — this is recommended when you don't know everything up front.

A model can have an arbitrary number of fields, of any type — each one represents a column of data that we want to store in one of our database tables. Each database record (row) will consist of one of each field value.
