# Serverless Computing

Serverless is a cloud app development and execution model that devs can build and run code without managing a server, and without paying for idle cloud infrastructure.

Serverless does not mean "no servers" here though, the serverless is meant to describe the dev experience when dealing with these servers, they are invisible to the dev, who doesn't have to see, manage or interact with them in any way.

Pros:

1. improved productivity
2. pay for execution only
3. use any language
4. streamlined dev/ops cycles
5. cost effective performance
6. usage visibiliy

Cons:

1. Unacceptable latency for certain applications
2. Monitoring and debugging issues
3. vendor lock-in
