# Web Scraping

Remember to read the websites terms and conditions to understand the legality of the data you are about to use. make sure you are not downloading data too fast because this may break the website and you may be blocked from it.

step one will be to inspect the website, simply open up the dev tools. step two will be making sure we have out library imports taken care of, most importantly requests, and beautifulsoup. the next step will be to set the url and the get request.parse the request, and find what you're looking for.
