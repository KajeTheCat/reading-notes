# TDD

Test-Driven development for short, is a test where you write the tests first before the code that you need to test the behavior of. Titles of these tests should be very descriptive of what the test is meant to do so that we can easily read what the test was for. It also makes sense to match the module name for the test, ex: app.py -> test_app.py

One thing to note is AAA:
1. Arrange
2. Act
3. Assert
