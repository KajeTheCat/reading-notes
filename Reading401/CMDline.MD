# The Command line

## Introduction
A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text. The command line will also typically present you with a prompt for issuing commands. A quick shortcut to use is the up and down arrows as they allow you to recycle previous commands you used.

## Basic navigation
Commands that may assist with this are as follows:
1. pwd : this will tell you the current working directory you are in.
2. ls : will display everything inside your current directory.
3. cd : will allow you to move into or out of a directory, and if you know the exact path you wish to travel, you can chain the cd by adding a '/' between each target directory.

## File manipulation
We can manipulate our files by creating a directory or a blank file, removing, moving or even copying them by using these inputs:
1. mkdir
Make Directory - ie. Create a directory.
2. rmdir
Remove Directory - ie. Delete a directory.
3. touch
Create a blank file.
4. cp
Copy - ie. Copy a file or directory.
5. mv
Move - ie. Move a file or directory (can also be used to rename).
6. rm
Remove - ie. Delete a file.
