# Django REST Framework & Docker

Docker is just a type of virtualization. Virtual environments are used to isolate Python software packages locally. We can create an isolated box for individual projects so one can use Python 2.7 and Django 1.5 while another can use Python 3.5 and Django 2.1 on the same computer.

## Account and installation

+ Download the desktop app.
+ Check version. "docker --version"
