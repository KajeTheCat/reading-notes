# whiteboard tips

Restate the question to make sure you understand what your task is.

ask about edge cases, qualifying questions to help guide the end result, and same with test cases.

ask if pseudo code is needed, if not write it and ask if it makes sense to keep the interviewers involved.

write your final code.

It's not illegal to ask for help, just if you do, make it conversational. You might recieve a no but that is fine.
