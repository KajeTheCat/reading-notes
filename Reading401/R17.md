# Encryption and Decryption

One of the earliest techniques of encryption was invented by Julius Ceaser and was used to communicate with his allies. The Ceasar Cipher is very versatile, allowing 25 different single letter variations or even entire word encryptions.
Encryption: scrambling the data according to a secret key (in this case, the alphabet shift).
Decryption: recovering the original data from scrambled data by using the secret key.
Code cracking: uncovering the original data without knowing the secret, by using a variety of clever techniques.
