# read and write in python

## what is a file?
Python files on most modern systems will consist of three main parts:

1. Header
2. Data
3. End of File(EOF)

When accessing a file on an operating system a file path will be required and it will look something like:

1. Folder path
2. File name
3. Extension

an example from the reading:
/
│
├── path/
|   │
│   ├── to/
│   │   └── cats.gif
│   │
│   └── dog_breeds.txt
|
└── animals.csv
