# ES6 Classes

JacaScript objects use prototype-based inheritance, and it's design is fairly similar from class inheritance strictly Object Oriented programming like Java and C#.

It can be described by saying that when methods or properties are stuck to an object's prototype they become open for use on that object and its children, but not directly stuck to them.

When you use the 'class' and 'extends' keywords internally, JavaScript will still use prototype based inheritance. It just simplifies the syntax also often called "Syntactic Sugar".

1. function() becomes class {}.
2. call() becomes extends.
3. classes are standalone, self-contained object factories.
   * Ultimately resulting in a prototype.
   * And are magnitudes easier for the developer to handle and read.
