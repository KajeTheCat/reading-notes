# lists and keys

1. What does .map() return? essentially map returns the value with whatever modifications made into a new array.
2. If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React? JSX allows embedding any expression in curly braces so you would just create the map method inside the function.
3. Each list item needs a unique key.
4. What is the purpose of a key? the purpose of a key is to differentiate from all the other items.

# What is the spread operator?

1. List 4 things that the spread operator can do. copy an array, add an item to a list, add to a state in react, and combine objects.
2. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.

>const objectOne = {hello: "🤪"}
const objectTwo = {world: "🐻"}
const objectThree = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: "😂"}
console.log(objectThree) // Object { hello: "🤪", world: "🐻", laugh: "😂" }
const objectFour = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: () => {console.log("😂".repeat(5))}}
objectFour.laugh() // 😂😂😂😂😂

3. Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.

>const fewFruit = ['🍏','🍊','🍌']
const fewMoreFruit = ['🍉', '🍍', ...fewFruit]
console.log(fewMoreFruit) //  Array(5) [ "🍉", "🍍", "🍏", "🍊", "🍌" ]

4. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.

>const myArray = [`🤪`,`🐻`,`🎌`]
const yourArray = [`🙂`,`🤗`,`🤩`]
const ourArray = [...myArray,...yourArray]
console.log(...ourArray) // 🤪 🐻 🎌 🙂 🤗 🤩



# How to Pass Functions Between Components

In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components? The dev creates a state changing function called increment.
In your own words, what does the increment function do? The increment function adds one point to the count of the person that gets the button click.
How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component? pass it into the object by inserting the call inside the object being used.
How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?
using 'this.props.~(this.props.~)'

## Things I want to know more about

just more on passing function calls around.
