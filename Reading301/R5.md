# Controlled

1. What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
* With a controlled component, the input’s value is always driven by the React state. While this means you have to type a bit more code, you can now pass the value to other UI elements too, or reset it from other event handlers.

2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
* I believe it would be wise to update the state with their responses, and allow them to overwrite it by clicking the submit.

3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
* When you need to handle multiple controlled input elements, you can add a name attribute to each element and let the handler function choose what to do based on the value of event.target.name.

# Ternary

1. Why would we use a ternary operator?
* It would be used to shorten code.

2. Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:
>if(x===y){
console.log(true);
} else {
console.log(false);
}

x===y ? 'yes' : 'no'
