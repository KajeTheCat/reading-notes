# Functional Programming

1. What is functional programming?
>Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
It returns the same result if given the same arguments

+ It returns the same result if given the same arguments
+ It does not cause any observable side effects

3. What are the benefits of a pure function?
stability and predictability. no need to test.

4. What is immutability?
When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created.

5. What is Referential transparency?
pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency
