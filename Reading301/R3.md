# React life cycle

1. Based off the diagram, the render happens before the componentdidmount.

2. The first thing to happen in the lifecycle of react is the initial mount.

3. Constructor, Render, React updates, componentdidmount, then finally componentwillunmount.

4. componentDidMount() is invoked immediately after a component is mounted (inserted into the tree). Initialization that requires DOM nodes should go here. If you need to load data from a remote endpoint, this is a good place to instantiate the network request.

# React State vs Props

props are passed to components whereas states live inside components.

## Things I want to know more about.

I would like to learn more about the differences between props and states just as a whole since a six minute video didnt cover much.
