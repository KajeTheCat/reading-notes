# Thinking in react

What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?

* A technique used to decide if you should create a new function or object.
* A component should ideally only do one thing and if it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.

What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?

* to build components that reuse other components and pass data using props.


What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?

1.  Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.
2.  Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.
3. Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.
How can you identify where state needs to live?

1. Identify every component that renders something based on that state.
2. Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).
3. Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.
4. If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.
