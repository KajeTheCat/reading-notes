# Lists
    bullet points and arrays, many uses including storing large amounts of data.

# Boxes
    boxes let you encase selected targets, change margins, and even color specific backgrounds.

# Basic Javascript instructions
    Arrays let you organize data
    you can access items in an array by entering the number of the item inside brackets
    every array will have a value called length

# Decisions and loops
    loops run until broken, or infinitely if done incorrectly.
    switch statements let you change the route of the loop if something else is input
    loops can do several things regarding counting up instances or asking questions

    lists collect data, boxes contain data, javascript lets you change and form the page to your liking, and loops help retrieve more data.
