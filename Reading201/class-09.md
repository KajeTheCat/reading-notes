# Forms
form controls exist everywhere, making use of text input, making choices such as check boxes and drop downs, and even submission methods like buttons.
## List, tables, and forms
we can even go as far as styling the smallest detail like pressing the button with css.
### Events
interactions create events, events trigger code, and then the code responds to the user. event listeners tell event handlers what to do, much like skyrims listener tells the dark brotherhood who needs an assassination done.
