## Layout

building blocks- css treats each html element as if it is in its own box this box will either be a block level box or an inline box.
block level elements include
+ h#
+ p
+ ul
+ li

Inline elements include
+ img
+ b
+ i

repeating the same thing from the original reading?

advantages of wireframing for css, are that they save you from repeatedly writing code for the same tasks, and that they will have been tested across different browser versions.

disadvantages are that they often require that you use class names in your HTML.
